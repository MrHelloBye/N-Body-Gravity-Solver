# N-Body-Gravity-Solver

An Euler many body solver I wrote for fun.

Compile using `clang++ *.cpp -std=c++11 -o Gravity`

`initial.py`  randomly generates particles within a predefined box in space and velocity.

`scatter_anim.py` generates a scatter plot animation of the particle trajectories. It will ask for the number of frames and the time interval for the animation.
